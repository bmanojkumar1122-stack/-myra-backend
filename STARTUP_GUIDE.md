## 📋 WHAT HAPPENS

When you run either command above:

1. ✅ **Backend Server starts** (Python FastAPI on port 8000)
   - Handles all app commands
   - Manages Spotify, YouTube, WhatsApp
   - System control operations
   - Voice intent routing

2. ✅ **Frontend starts** (Vite dev server on port 5173)
   - React UI
   - Real-time socket.io connection
   - Voice input interface

3. ✅ **Electron starts** (Desktop application)
   - Fullscreen desktop app
   - Connects to backend on port 8000
   - Ready for voice commands

## 🛠️ MANUAL METHOD (If Script Doesn't Work)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd g:\ada_v2-main\backend
python server.py
```
Wait for: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`

**Terminal 2 - Frontend + Electron:**
```powershell
cd g:\ada_v2-main
npm run dev
```
Wait for: Electron window to open

## ✅ VERIFICATION

Check if everything is working:

1. **Backend Running?**
   - Visit http://localhost:8000/docs in browser
   - Should see API documentation

2. **Frontend Running?**
   - Visit http://localhost:5173 in browser
   - Should see React UI

3. **Electron Connected?**
   - Desktop window should be open
   - Should show ADA interface
   - Voice input should be enabled

4. **Voice Commands Working?**
   - Speak a command in Electron
   - Check browser console (F12) for messages
   - Commands should execute in real-time

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Port 8000 already in use"
```powershell
# Kill existing process
Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*server.py*"} | Stop-Process -Force
```

### "Port 5173 already in use"
```powershell
# Kill existing npm process
Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force
```

### "Electron not connecting to backend"
1. Make sure backend is running on port 8000
2. Check backend console for errors (should see Socket.IO connected)
3. Restart both services

### "Commands not executing"
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check backend terminal for error messages
3. Ensure all three services are running
