# WhatsApp Video & Voice Call Features for MYRA

## ✅ Features Complete & Integrated

WhatsApp video call and voice call features are **now permanently integrated** into MYRA. You can use voice commands to initiate calls with any WhatsApp contact.

## How to Use

### Via Voice Command (Electron/MYRA)
When you have MYRA running in Electron, simply say:

#### Video Calls:
- "Video call papa"
- "Video call with mama"
- "Start video call to brother"
- "Call sister on video"

#### Voice Calls:
- "Voice call papa"
- "Call mama"
- "Phone call to brother"
- "Audio call sister"

MYRA will:
1. Automatically open WhatsApp Desktop
2. Find the contact
3. Initiate the call (video or audio)
4. Return a confirmation

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
Voice Command → MYRA (ada.py)
    ↓
Google's Gemini AI recognizes intent
    ↓
Calls whatsapp_control tool with action: "video_call" or "voice_call"
    ↓
WhatsAppAgent.video_call() or WhatsAppAgent.voice_call()
    ↓
Desktop Automation (pyautogui)
    ↓
Call initiated with WhatsApp contact
```

### Technical Implementation

**Video Call Flow:**
1. Focus WhatsApp window
2. Open new chat with Ctrl+N
3. Type and select contact
4. Trigger video call with Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard shortcut
5. Call connects

**Voice Call Flow:**
1. Focus WhatsApp window
2. Open new chat with Ctrl+N
3. Type and select contact
4. Trigger voice call with Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard shortcut
5. Call connects

## Supported Contacts

Pre-configured quick contacts:
- **Papa** / **Papa Ji** → Papa
- **Mom** / **Mama** → Mom
- **Brother** / **Bhai** → Brother
- **Sister** / **Behen** → Sister
- **Friend** → Friend

Plus any WhatsApp contact name in your contacts list.

## Files Modified

1. **backend/whatsapp_agent.py**
   - Improved `video_call()` with Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard shortcut
   - Improved `voice_call()` with Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard shortcut
   - Better timing (2s delays for reliability)
   - Uses `pyautogui.write()` for better compatibility

2. **backend/ada.py** (already configured)
   - `whatsapp_control` tool supports "video_call" and "voice_call" actions
   - Handles voice → WhatsApp conversion automatically
   - Integrated with Gemini AI for intent recognition

## Testing

To test the video call directly:
```bash
python backend/test_video_call.py
```

Or use the agent directly:
```python
from whatsapp_agent import get_whatsapp_agent

agent = get_whatsapp_agent()

# Video call
result = agent.video_call('papa')
print(result)

# Voice call
result = agent.voice_call('mama')
print(result)
```

## Expected Output

When you test:
```
=== WhatsApp Video Call Test ===

Initiating video call with Papa...

Result:
  Success: True
  Message: Video call initiated with papa

✅ VIDEO CALL WORKING!
```

## Troubleshooting

**Call not initiating?**
- Ensure WhatsApp window is visible
- Check that contact exists in your WhatsApp
- Try with full contact name
- Make sure keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V/C) isn't blocked

**WhatsApp not opening?**
- WhatsApp Desktop must be installed
- Check: `tasklist | findstr WhatsApp`
- Try opening WhatsApp manually first

**Can't hear/see call?**
- May need to grant microphone/camera permissions to WhatsApp
- Check Windows privacy settings
- Test call in WhatsApp manually first

## Voice Command Examples

### Video Calls
```
"Hey MYRA, video call papa"
→ MYRA: "Initiating video call with papa"
→ WhatsApp opens and calls papa on video

"Video call with mama"
→ Video call to mama starts

"Start video call to brother"
→ Video call to brother begins
```

### Voice Calls
```
"Hey MYRA, voice call papa"
→ MYRA: "Initiating voice call with papa"
