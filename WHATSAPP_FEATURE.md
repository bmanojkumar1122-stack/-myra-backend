# WhatsApp Messaging Feature for MYRA

## ✅ Feature Complete

The WhatsApp messaging feature is now **permanently integrated** into MYRA. You can now use voice commands to send messages directly to any WhatsApp contact.

## How to Use

### Via Voice Command (Electron/MYRA)
When you have MYRA running in Electron, simply say:

1. **"Send message to papa: hello"**
2. **"Message mama: how are you"**
3. **"Tell brother: see you later"**
4. **"Send to [contact name]: [your message]"**

MYRA will:
- Automatically open WhatsApp Desktop
- Find the contact
- Send the message
- Return a confirmation

### How It Works

1. **Trigger**: You say a message with a contact name
2. **Processing**: MYRA recognizes the `whatsapp_control` tool request
3. **Execution**: The WhatsApp agent takes over:
   - Opens/focuses WhatsApp Desktop
   - Uses keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N for new chat)
   - Types contact name and finds them
   - Types your message
   - Sends with Enter key
4. **Confirmation**: MYRA tells you the message was sent

## Supported Commands

All variations work:
- "Send message to [contact]: [text]"
- "Message [contact]: [text]"
- "Tell [contact]: [text]"
- "WhatsApp [contact]: [text]"

## Contacts Available

Pre-configured quick contacts (in whatsapp_v2.py):
- **Papa** / **Papa Ji** → Papa
- **Mom** / **Mama** → Mom
- **Brother** / **Bhai** → Brother
- **Sister** / **Behen** → Sister
- **Friend** → Friend

You can also use full contact names from your WhatsApp contacts.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **backend/whatsapp_agent.py**
   - Improved `send_message()` with better timing (2s delays for reliability)
   - Uses `pyautogui.write()` instead of `typewrite()` for compatibility
   - Integrated with AppLauncher for WhatsApp opening

2. **backend/ada.py**
   - `whatsapp_control` tool already integrated
   - Handles voice → WhatsApp conversion automatically

3. **backend/whatsapp_v2.py**
   - Updated with improved timings
   - Contact aliases pre-configured

    ↓
WhatsAppAgent.send_message()
    ↓
Desktop Automation (pyautogui)
    ↓
Message sent to WhatsApp contact
```

## Requirements

- WhatsApp Desktop installed (from Microsoft Store)
- Desktop app must be able to be launched via `whatsapp://` URI
- MYRA must have focus/window focus for automation

## Testing

To test the feature directly:
```bash
python backend/test_MYRA_whatsapp.py
```

Or use the WhatsApp agent directly:
```python
from whatsapp_agent import get_whatsapp_agent

agent = get_whatsapp_agent()
result = agent.send_message('papa', 'hello')
print(result)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Message not sending?**
- Ensure WhatsApp window is visible
- Check that contact exists in your WhatsApp
- Try with full contact name
- Wait 2-3 seconds between commands

**WhatsApp not opening?**
- Make sure WhatsApp Desktop is installed
- Check if process is running: `tasklist | findstr WhatsApp`
- Try opening WhatsApp manually first, then use voice commands

## Future Enhancements
