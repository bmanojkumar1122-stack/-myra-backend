MYRA now works like **i/Jarvis** - it can:
- 🚀 Open apps instantly without asking
- ⌨️ Type text without confirmation
- 🔊 Control volume and brightness silently
- 🎯 Never bother you with popups for trusted actions
- 💾 Remember everything across restarts

## Enable Trusted Mode (Right Now!)

### Voice Commands

**Say any of these to MYRA:**

```
"MYRA, is system ko trust kar lo"
```
or simply
```
"enable trusted mode"
```

✅ **Response:** "Trusted Mode enabled. I'll minimize popups for trusted apps and actions."

---

## Configure Allowed Apps

**Tell MYRA which apps to trust:**

```
"MYRA, f chrome aur notepad allow karo"
```
or
```
"allow chrome and vscode"
```

✅ **Response:** "I'll trust chrome, notepad to open without asking."

---

## Make It Permanent

**So you don't need to set it up every restart:**

```
"MYRA, future me popup mat dikhana"
```
or
```
"remember forever"
```

✅ **Response:** "I'll remember your trust decisions even after restart."

---

## Now Watch the Magic ✨

Say:
```
"Open chrome"
"Open vscode"
"Set volume to 50%"

## What's Safe to Trust?

## Behind the Scenes

What MYRA does when you say "Open Chrome":

```
1. Model detects: system_control tool with action=open_app, app_name=chrome
2. Backend checks: Is chrome in allowed_apps? Is open_app allowed?
3. Result: ✅ YES → SKIP POPUP
4. Chrome opens instantly
5. You see: Brief toast "Trusted action executed" ✨
```

Without trusted mode, you'd see a big confirmation popup. With it, just ⚡ instant execution!

---

## Advanced Usage (For Developers)

### Check Current Config
```python
from trusted_permissions import get_trusted_manager
mgr = get_trusted_manager()
print(mgr.get_config())
```

### View Logs
```bash
tail -f system_agent.log | grep TRUSTED
```

### Reset Everything
```bash
# Delete the config file
rm backend/trusted_permissions.json
# Or just say: "MYRA, reset trusted mode"
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Is it secure?**
A: Yes! Dangerous operations (file delete, shell commands) always require confirmation. You consciously enable it.

**Q: Does it survive restart?**
A: Only if you say "remember forever". Otherwise it resets.

**Q: Can I disable it?**
A: Yes! Just say "disable trusted mode" anytime.

**Q: What if I don't enable it?**
A: Everything works like before - all actions show popups.

**Q: Can I trust specific apps only?**
A: Yes! Say "allow chrome and notepad" - only those apps skip popups.
