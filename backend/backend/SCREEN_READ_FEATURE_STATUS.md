2. Find: tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.x.x.exe
3. Run installer → Install to C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR
4. Done! ✅
```

**B) With Chocolatey** (if installed)
```powershell
choco install tesseract
```

### 🎯 Voice Commands (Use In Electron)

Once Tesseract is installed, use these voice commands:

```
"Read the screen"
→ MYRA captures screen and reads all visible text

"Screen ko read kar"
→ Hindi: Read the screen

"Ye likha kya hai?"
→ Hindi: What's written here?

"Read the screen and tell me"
→ Captures, reads, and speaks back to you
```

### 🔧 How It Works (Behind The Scenes)

```
User speaks: "Read the screen"
    ↓
MYRA parses intent → Calls screen_read tool
    ↓
backend/ada.py handlers:
  1. Instantiates ScreenReader()
  2. Calls read_screen(region=None)
    ↓
backend/screen_reader_simple.py:
  1. Captures primary monitor with mss
  2. Converts to PIL Image
  3. Runs Tesseract OCR
  4. Returns extracted text
    ↓
Ada.py returns to MYRA:
  "On your screen I see: [text content]..."
    ↓
MYRA speaks response to user
```

### ⚡ Pro Tips

**Tip 1**: After installing Tesseract, restart the backend server:
```bash
python backend/server.py
```

**Tip 2**: Test with simple screens first (text-heavy pages like Gmail, notes, etc.)

**Tip 3**: OCR works best with clear, standard fonts. Handwritten text or decorative fonts may not be recognized.

**Tip 4**: For specific regions, you can use:
```json
{
  "region": {
    "left": 100,
    "top": 100,
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600
  }
}
```

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Q: "tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH"**
A: Download and install from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

**Q: "No text detected"**
A: Screen may be blank, or text quality too low for OCR. Try a browser window instead.

**Q: "Module not found errors"**
A: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
